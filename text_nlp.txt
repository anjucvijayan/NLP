'Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them.So when they where old enough,she sent them out into the world to see their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy.He didnâ€™t want to work at all and he built his house outof straw.The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.It was a  sturdy house complete with fine fireplace and chimney.It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.'
